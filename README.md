# Digital Letter System
Students in college require permissions from their respective class, branch, and college heads for attending and conducting events or letâ€™s just say permissions for anything. To fulfil this, students end up writing letters and carry these letters to their respective heads and waste most of their time, energy, and paper.

To solve this problem we built a solution that can automate this whole process digitally with a smooth flow in the permission process.

* students can login and upload the documents and send to desired faculty and check the status of documents.
* faculty can login and verify the received docs and accpet/reject them.
* Each action is notified with email for both faculty and students.
